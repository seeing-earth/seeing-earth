### :earth_americas: [Seeing Earth](https://seeing.earth) (Join us on [Discord!](https://discord.gg/4upD6bs))

**Problem:** We don't have an accurate worldview of the fundamental drivers + causes of the environmental crisis.  As a result, our actions and discussions rarely get to the level of root causes and meaningful solutions.

**Intention:** Enable people to *see* and *understand* the largest levers impacting our environment, so we can turn our attention and energy towards the most impactful + urgent interventions.

**Example:** Today, if a person is interested in supporting rainforest conservation, most resources will point them to sustainable shopping decisions.  Unless you make that change in a way that scales (e.g. asking neighbors and your community to join you), it is a negligible intervention.

In reality, there are much more impactful ways for that person to support rainforest conservation -- for example, calling on their city/state to ban the import of unsustainable rainforest products, as [LA and NYC have started exploring](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/amazon-rainforest-wildfires-nyc-and-la-officials-urge-boycott-of-meat-companies-linked-to-amazon-fires/).

The intention behind **Seeing Earth** is to help people intuitively understand the largest causes + levers of the environmental crisis, and turn their attention towards a higher level of action.

### Context

The [current site](https://seeing.earth) is a visual proof of concept.

The useful takeaway is how it models/representats the environmental crisis — as a series of nested causal relationships, rendered in a (hopefully) intuitive way.

Exploring a high-level cause of the environmental crisis, such as Amazon deforestation, reveals its component causes — including national policy and international supply chains.  Exploring the international supply chains, such as China's beef imports or the US's unsustainable logging imports, reveals the specific cities where those products are headed.  This gives a view of the high-level cause at different levels, and enables us to consider interventions at different levels.

Is the causality distributed across many points?  Is it concentrated in a few areas (Pareto distribution)?

Is political action viable at the national level?  If not, can there be educational / public-facing interventions that appeal to the country at large?  Any other viable national interventions?  Or is causality concentrated in a small enough group of cities, that we can have the highest leverage working at the city level?

These are the types of questions and decisions that Seeing Earth should help guide.  It's not about helping people answer "what can I do?"  It's about helping all of us recognize the most urgent problems, compare different opportunities for impact, and hopefully make the best decisions we can.

Much of this information is data-driven, and that data lives in a variety of places with a variety of standards, units, and ontologies.

To make Seeing Earth an intuitive tool, it will require pulling together these disparate data sources and being able to view the data they provide in a cohesive world view.  Ex: Supply chains are a cause of deforestation, and national policies are too.  How can we model those two types of data in the same view?

To that end, the intention of the MCJ Make-A-Thon is to develop a scalable and cross-dimensional foundation for this tool — perhaps in the form of a data schema – which can incorporate data sources such as -- 

- [WorldMRIO Data](https://https://worldmrio.com/)
- [Electricity Map](https://www.electricitymap.org/ranking)
- [Ocean Plastic Data](https://theoceancleanup.com/sources/)
- Political trends
- Cultural trends
- Crowdsourced datasets

-- and intermingle those data sources in a useful, informative worldview.

This foundation should enable us to inform our actions with the data available today, and enable us to continue adding data over time, getting a more refined and expansive view of the causes of our environmental crisis.
