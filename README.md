### :earth_americas: **Home**

Around the world, millions of people recognize the challenges facing us.

*Climate change.  Plastic waste.  Surveillance capitalism.  Species extinction.  Artificial intelligence.  Economic collapse.*

(To name a few.)

And we're looking for ways to make a difference in these issues in our everyday lives.

But aside from individual action (which, realistically, is limited) -- almost none of us have actionable and contextual information for how *we* personally can start making a real impact.

This is a massive opportunity cost.  Every day we lack that information, is a day that we delay critical action.

However -- it isn't that we're unsure of the changes and transitions we need to begin.

To the contrary, have limitless resources about our environment and the actions needed to protect it:


*  [Project Drawdown](https://www.drawdown.org/solutions/table-of-solutions)   

*  [Energy Zones Mapping Tool](https://ezmt.anl.gov/)   

*  [Vizzuality](https://www.vizzuality.com/project/)   

But all of these resources are siloed -- and none give contextual, actionalbe information for the everyday person.

Looking at Project Drawdown, I can see that the #3 solution is adopting “plant-rich diets.” 

And after reading that, I can decide to go vegetarian in my life.  But in the big picture, what difference does one more vegetarian really make?

And what about the opportunity cost?  Instead of spending weeks researching vegetarianism, finding new foods and recipes and even stores, is there a better way I can apply my time and effort to making "plant-rich diets" a reality?

Most likely, yes. (Instead of individually transitioning to a plant-rich diet behind the walls of your home, what if you organized to help your *community* transition to plant-rich diets?) 

But looking at a resource like Project Drawdown, you never would see it.

Whatever your passion and whatever your skills, you have countless opportunities to make a major impact in your very own neighborhood.

You just need to see those opportunities.

And Home is a map of them.

**UX/Product Notes**

Home is envisioned as a world map, marked by environmental initiatives and community projects, across every country in the world.

On this map, you can explore impact areas you’re passionate about (e.g. Regenerative Agriculture, Zero-Waste, Energy, Community-Building) — and view specific, high-impact ways you contribute to those causes in your local context.

If you’re in Arizona, that could be proposing a solar farm in a vacant town lot.  If you’re in Kansas, that could be planning a community energy grid, to plug-in to nearby windmills.  If you’re in Canada or Australia, that could be organizing to block a proposed fossil fuel development, and protecting the local ecosystem that would be destroyed.

These recommendations would be sourced from our many available environmental/conservation/sustainability resources (e.g. Drawdown, Energy Zones Mapping Tool, Global Forest Watch), and rendered in a way to make them accessible and actionable for everyday citizens.

And everyday, instead of “looking for something to do” on the Internet, you can see plenty of things you can do for your local community and the planet at large.

When you find an opportunity you’re interested in, you can quickly turn it into an initial proposal and publish that proposal to the map.

This gives others a chance to review the proposal and provide feedback (more important for higher-cost efforts), and by making the proposal public, you can inspire others in your community by showing them what’s happening nearby and how they can also get involved.

On the note of inspiring others, in the research paper [Cultural Evolution of Sustainable Behaviors: Pro-environmental Tipping Points in an Agent-Based Model](https://www.cell.com/one-earth/fulltext/S2590-3322(20)30003-8?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2590332220300038%3Fshowall%3Dtrue), this process of inspiration is described as follows:


> *Agents move in a landscape of affordances where they encounter either pro-environmental or non-environmental affordances and act upon them (i.e., behave pro- or non-environmentally).  Behaviors then lead to the development of habits, social transmission (learning or copying behaviors from others), and the modification of the landscape of affordances (i.e., cultural niche construction). In particular, we show how the composition of affordances in a socio-ecological system, such as infrastructures that afford pro-environmental behaviors, plays an essential role in shaping collective behavioral patterns. Our model illustrates how even linear increases in pro-environmental affordances can lead to the non-linear adoption of collective pro-environmental behavioral patterns.* 

Essentially, when people can see your behavior (in real-life or in the digital world), they can learn and adopt that behavior.

In the case of Home, that behavior is making impactful contributions to environmental and community initatives.

In this way, you can also think of the map as social network of change-makers.  (Complete with an embedded chat app, like Discord, as a communication layer and news feed for the community.)

If successful, a tool like this could empower millions of communities to start taking an active role in building their future.

## **Constraints to Overcome**

In particular, lowering the barrier to entry for organizing community/collective actions. 

It's easy to make a change as an individual -- however, speaking frankly, the impact of doing so is minimal (especially if others can't see it and learn from it).

Up until now, the process of organizing larger groups around a given cause has been more difficult. 

According to [Momentum](https://www.momentumcommunity.org/), one of the most successful organizing methodologies, you sometimes need to *start* with a mass protest!  And that's just for getting people on board, let alone starting to take action. 

If Home can streamline the process of community organizing for high-impact actions, this will be a major breakthrough in enabling the types of transitions we need.

## **We Assume that...**

1. We assume that citizen-led, bottom-up action is a feasible way of facilitating local transitions.

2. We assume that the knowledge to guide high-impact transitions and actions is available.

3. We assume that this knowledge can be translated/rendered in a user-centric way for everyday citizens.

4. We assume that a digital map can be an effective interface to translate/render this knowledge, for citizens to make sense of this knowledge, and for citizens to take action based on this knowledge.

5. We assume that digital proposals and commitments will translate to real-world action.

## **Who is the intended end user?  What is their role?**

At the moment, there are two types of envisioned end users:

*  Active Citizens (Amateurs)

*  Active Citizens (Subject Matter Experts)

Both amateurs and subject matter experts have a shared role in exploring action opportunities and making proposals.

However, subject matter experts have an additional role as a guide and a reviewer — they can share new action opportunities to the map, and they can evaluate proposals to add relevant details and determine feasibility.

## **Who else is working on similar solutions?  Why is Home unique or better?**

There are many apps and products focused on helping people make *individual* contributions towards conservation/environmental/sustainability efforts.

There are also a few early-stage social networks looking to do the same.

Finally, there are resources like Drawdown and the Energy Zones Mapping Tool, which can be impactful in the hands of organizations and high-up decisionmakers.

Home is unique, and potentially better, because of its map-based interface tied to high-impact actions — as well as it’s citizen-centric foundation.

For example …

1. The Home map can give citizens greater awareness of our global situation (imagine applying a Global Forest Watch filter, or an Ocean Plastic filter, to get a real sense of the state of our world) — and consequently, that awareness can generate greater urgency for taking action.
2. Map-based information can improve users' spatial/visual context, which can make the information presented inherently more actionable.
3. Home is oriented towards higher-impact collective efforts, which can be led by everyday citizens, as opposed to siloed individual efforts or actions customed for organizations and top-down decisionmakers.
4. Focused on collective efforts and providing visual context, Home has more potential for catalyzing social transmission, as compared to conventional social network feeds.

As a final note, [The Energy Zones Mapping Tool](https://ezmt.anl.gov/) is a strong example of visualizing environment-related opportunities (through the application of various filters as datasets.)

However, if you use the tool, you can see that it was clearly designed for high-level decisionmakers (specifically, [the Eastern Interconnected States Planning Council](https://ezmt.anl.gov/about_the_study)), and provides little information/context at the municipality or community level (where active citizens can take concrete efforts).

It also lacks the crowdsourcing and networking elements envisioned in Home (e.g. viewing public proposals, connecting with others involved), which limits the tool's potential for social transition.
