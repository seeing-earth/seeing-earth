### :earth_americas: **Home**

Around the world, millions of people recognize the challenges facing us.

*Climate change.  Plastic waste.  Surveillance capitalism.  Species extinction.  Artificial intelligence.  Economic collapse.*

(To name a few.)

And we're all looking for ways to make a difference in these issues in our everyday lives.

But aside from individual action (which, realistically, is limited) -- almost none of us have actionable and contextual information for how *we* personally can start making a meaningful difference.

This is a massive opportunity cost.  Every day we lack that information, is a day that we delay critical action.

**Description of Project**

An interactive map PPGIS, where users can:

-Search for suggested actions for their community    
-Start actions in their community    
-Join ongoing actions in their community    

The MVP of the "action" described above is an email thread.  When starting an action, the creator adds several neighbors' email addresses.  Upon publishing, the creator and invited neighbors receive a joint email, guiding them on ways to start taking action -- specifically, *in ways that can scale across the community* -- and they can use the email thread to start discussing their plans and working together.
Importantly, these participants can also easily invite other neighbors to join in the action, simply by adding that neighbor's email address to a reply.

Simple, easy, frictionless.

Likewise, if you want to join an existing action in your community, you simply find it on the map, click "join this action", and enter your email address.
You will be added to the community email thread for that action, where you can join other neighbors and the discussion/work they've begun.

Simple, easy, frictionless.

**Why does Home matter?**

There are countless websites, applications, and resources encouraging people to make important changes in their lives -- from sustainable living to online privacy.

However, these resources are all focused on *individuals.* And acting as individuals, our impact is realistically limited.

In the [words of John Javna](https://grist.org/climate/how-people-came-to-believe-that-individual-choices-could-save-the-earth/), author of “50 Simple Things You Can Do to Save the Earth”:

> In the end, if anything works, it’s not spreading yourself as thin as possible and doing the easiest possible things.  The path to success, is joining a community of people trying to change something for the better — and if the system is set up effectively, then doing the right thing becomes simple.    

On the other hand, acting as communities can bring about tremendous change.  [According to Harvard researcher Erica Chenoweth](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190513-it-only-takes-35-of-people-to-change-the-world), “movements that engage 3.5% of the population have never failed to bring about change.”

Home is an effort to help people start impactful actions *as a community.*

Not by sharing actions on social media and hoping for “viral growth”, as most status quo applications encourage.

But by spreading through densely connected grassroots networks — which, when it comes to spreading complex changes, are the most robust and efficient kinds of networks.

This approach is inspired by Damon Centrola’s research on [How Behavior Spreads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0fDcUJMzkI) and Roope Karonen’s research on [social tipping points](https://www.cell.com/one-earth/fulltext/S2590-3322(20)30003-8?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2590332220300038%3Fshowall%3Dtrue#articleInformation).

## **Constraints to Overcome**

In particular, lowering the barrier to entry for organizing community/collective actions. 

It's easy to make a change as an individual -- however, speaking frankly, the impact of doing so is minimal (especially if others can't see it and learn from it).

Up until now, the process of organizing larger groups around a given cause has been more difficult. 

According to [Momentum](https://www.momentumcommunity.org/), one of the most successful organizing methodologies, you sometimes need to *start* with a mass protest!  And that's just for getting people on board, let alone starting to take action. 

If Home can streamline the process of community organizing for high-impact actions, this will be a major breakthrough in enabling the types of transitions we need.

## **We Assume that...**

1. We assume that citizen-led, bottom-up action is a feasible way of facilitating local transitions.

2. We assume that the knowledge to guide high-impact transitions and actions is available.

3. We assume that this knowledge can be translated/rendered in a user-centric way for everyday citizens.

4. We assume that a digital map can be an effective interface to translate/render this knowledge, for citizens to make sense of this knowledge, and for citizens to take action based on this knowledge.

5. We assume that digital proposals and commitments will translate to real-world action.

## **Who is the intended end user?  What is their role?**

At the moment, there are two types of envisioned end users:

*  Active Citizens (Amateurs)

*  Active Citizens (Subject Matter Experts)

Both amateurs and subject matter experts have a shared role in exploring action opportunities and making proposals.

However, subject matter experts have an additional role as a guide and a reviewer — they can share new action opportunities to the map, and they can evaluate proposals to add relevant details and determine feasibility.

## **Who else is working on similar solutions?  Why is Home unique or better?**

There are many apps and products focused on helping people make *individual* contributions towards conservation/environmental/sustainability efforts.

There are also a few early-stage social networks looking to do the same.

Finally, there are resources like Drawdown and the Energy Zones Mapping Tool, which can be impactful in the hands of organizations and high-up decisionmakers.

Home is unique, and potentially better, because of its map-based interface tied to high-impact actions — as well as it’s citizen-centric foundation.

For example …

1. The Home map can give citizens greater awareness of our global situation (imagine applying a Global Forest Watch filter, or an Ocean Plastic filter, to get a real sense of the state of our world) — and consequently, that awareness can generate greater urgency for taking action.
2. Map-based information can improve users' spatial/visual context, which can make the information presented inherently more actionable.
3. Home is oriented towards higher-impact collective efforts, which can be led by everyday citizens, as opposed to siloed individual efforts or actions customed for organizations and top-down decisionmakers.
4. Focused on collective efforts and providing visual context, Home has more potential for catalyzing social transmission, as compared to conventional social network feeds.

As a final note, [The Energy Zones Mapping Tool](https://ezmt.anl.gov/) is a strong example of visualizing environment-related opportunities (through the application of various filters as datasets.)

However, if you use the tool, you can see that it was clearly designed for high-level decisionmakers (specifically, [the Eastern Interconnected States Planning Council](https://ezmt.anl.gov/about_the_study)), and provides little information/context at the municipality or community level (where active citizens can take concrete efforts).

It also lacks the crowdsourcing and networking elements envisioned in Home (e.g. viewing public proposals, connecting with others involved), which limits the tool's potential for social transition.

## **Current Work**

-Laying the right groundwork from the project, in terms of design considerations and user experience 

-Exploring how knowledge from high-quality resources (e.g. Drawdown, Energy Zones Mapping Tool, Global Forest Watch) can be integrated/rendered into this project 

-Researching Social Tipping Points and social transmission, and exploring how they can be incorporated in an impactful way 

-Experimenting and iterating on prototype designs 

-Determining software architecture (user roles, user actions, user flows) 

-Scoping the design and technical requirements for an MVP 

-Writing the codebase for an MVP (can build on some open-source projects)

## **Current Needs**

-Funding

-Software development (specifically around interactive maps, rendering data sets, and data visualization)

-Knowledge/experience around community organizing and local sustainable development 

-Knowledge/experience around high-impact environmental actions 

-Knowledge/experience around linked data, privacy, and building Home as a system that enables users to own their data (and how that can work feasibly with the project’s aims)
