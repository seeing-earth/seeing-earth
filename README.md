## **The Problem**

Around the world, millions of people resonate with conservation and environmental movements.

People want to contribute to these causes, but they lack actionable and contextual information for how *they* personally can make a difference. 

This is a coordination problem, and it limits our capacity to build a better future.

The scope of this problem is worldwide — particularly concentrated in the Global North, where lifestyle and consumption choices lead to deforestation and ecosystem loss down the supply chain. 

As a simple example, if Global North communities transitioned to local plant-rich diets, that would alleviate demand for vacant land (e.g. for livestock and livestock feed), which would alleviate the need to raze forests, which would alleviate ecosystem destruction and species extinction. 

This perspective isn’t new. 

However, Home’s *approach* to the coordination problem is new.

## **The Solution**

A map of opportunities for high-impact environmental action. 

We have so many resources about our environment and the actions we need to take to protect it, e.g.


*  [Project Drawdown](https://www.drawdown.org/solutions/table-of-solutions)   

*  [Energy Zones Mapping Tool](https://ezmt.anl.gov/)   

*  [Vizzzuality](https://www.vizzuality.com/project/)   


However, all these resources are siloed — and none give contextual, actionable insights for the everyday person.

For example, the Global Forest Watch gives a a real-time picture of deforestation.

But looking at that map, I have no idea how *I* can help protect our forests.

And for every person like me, who wants to contribute but has no guide for action, we have a missed opportunity for positive impact.

As another example, the #3 solution on Project Drawdown is “plant-rich diets.” 

Reading that, I can decide to go vegetarian in my life — but what difference does that make in the big picture?

And what about the opportunity cost?  Is there a better way I can apply my time and effort to contribute to environmental and conservaiton movements?

Most likely, yes. (Instead of 1 million individuals transitioning to plant-rich diets, what if each of those 1 million individuals started organizing help their *communities* transition to plant-rich diets?) 

But with resources like Drawdown and Global Forest Watch, as they exist today, you would never see an opportunity like that.

And that results in a lot of missed opportunities.

Continuing the Drawdown exmaple, now imagine you're a citizen in Berlin, the vegan capital of the world. 

Would a community effort for plant-rich diets still be a good use of your time? 

Probably not. 

So what kind of impact can *you* personally make, there in Berlin?

Perhaps a local waste processing initiative (e.g. https://preciousplastic.com/), to prevent Berlin’s plastic from ending up in oceans.

Or, given your air pollution problems, perhaps an initiative to reduce car traffic in Berlin’s dirtiest district.

The point is, whatever your passion and whatever your skills, there are ways you can make impactful contributions to environmental and conservation movements in your very own neighborhood.

You just need to see those opportunities.

And Home is a map of them.

**UX/Product Notes**

Home's user experience is still taking shape.  It is envisioned roughly like this:

Home is your default browser page, so when you open your browser, this is the first thing you see:

A world map, marked by environmental initiatives and local sustainability projects, across every country in the world.

On this map, you can explore environment/conservation/sustainability areas you’re passionate about (say, Biodiversity and Conservation, Zero-Waste Systems, or Renewable Energy) — and view specific, high-impact ways you contribute to those causes in your local context.

If you’re in Arizona, that could be proposing a solar farm in a vacant town lot.  If you’re in Kansas, that could be planning a community energy grid, to plug-in to nearby windmills.  If you’re in Canada or Australia, that could be organizing to block a proposed fossil fuel development, and protecting the local ecosystem that would be destroyed.

These recommendations would be sourced from our many available environmental/conservation/sustainability resources (e.g. Drawdown, Energy Zones Mapping Tool, Global Forest Watch), and rendered in a way to make them accessible and actionable for everyday citizens.

And everyday, instead of “looking for something to do” on the Internet, you can see plenty of things you can do for your local community and the planet at large.

When you find an opportunity you’re interested in, you can quickly turn it into an initial proposal and publish that proposal to the map.

This gives others a chance to review the proposal and provide feedback (more important for higher-cost efforts), and by making it public, you can inspire others in your community by showing them what’s happening nearby and how they can also get involved.

On the note of inspiring others, in the research paper [Cultural Evolution of Sustainable Behaviors: Pro-environmental Tipping Points in an Agent-Based Model](https://www.cell.com/one-earth/fulltext/S2590-3322(20)30003-8?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2590332220300038%3Fshowall%3Dtrue), this process of inspiration is described as follows:


> *Agents move in a landscape of affordances where they encounter either pro-environmental or non-environmental affordances and act upon them (i.e., behave pro- or non-environmentally).  Behaviors then lead to the development of habits, social transmission (learning or copying behaviors from others), and the modification of the landscape of affordances (i.e., cultural niche construction). In particular, we show how the composition of affordances in a socio-ecological system, such as infrastructures that afford pro-environmental behaviors, plays an essential role in shaping collective behavioral patterns. Our model illustrates how even linear increases in pro-environmental affordances can lead to the non-linear adoption of collective pro-environmental behavioral patterns.* 

Essentially, when people can see your behavior (in real-life or in the digital world), they can learn and adopt that behavior.

In the case of Home, that behavior is making impactful contributions to conservation and environmental movements.

In this way, you can also think of the map as social network of conservation and sustainable action.  (Complete with an embedded chat app, like Discord, as a communication layer and news feed for the community.)

And if successful, this could be a high-impact tool to address the coordination problem described above -- and get many millions of communities actively involved in environmental and conservation movements.

## **Constraints to Overcome**

In particular, lowering the barrier to entry for organizing community/collective actions. 

It's easy to make a change as an individual -- however, speaking frankly, the impact of doing so is minimal (especially if others can't see it and learn from it).

Up until now, the process of organizing larger groups around a given cause has been more difficult. 

According to [Momentum](https://www.momentumcommunity.org/), one of the most successful organizing methodologies, you sometimes need to *start* with a mass protest!  And that's just for getting people on board, let alone starting to take action. 

If Home can streamline the process of community organizing for high-impact environmental actions, this will be a major breakthrough in enabling the types of transitions we need.

## **We Assume that...**

1. We assume that lifestyle and consumption choices (particularly in Global North communities) have a significant effect on ecosystem loss and extinction rates

2. We assume that high-impact community transitions can alleviate resource-intensive demands (e.g. land use, livestock feed), which can alleviate resource extraction, ecosystem loss, and extinction rates

3. We assume that citizen-led, bottom-up action is a feasible way of facilitating local transitions.

4. We assume that the knowledge to guide high-impact transitions and actions is available.

5. We assume that this knowledge can be translated/rendered in a user-centric way for everyday citizens.

6. We assume that a digital map can be an effective interface to translate/render this knowledge, for citizens to make sense of this knowledge, and for citizens to take action based on this knowledge.

7. We assume that digital proposals and commitments will translate to real-world action.

8. We assume that social transmission can occur through a digital public map.

## **Who is the intended end user?  What is their role?**

At the moment, there are two types of envisioned end users:

*  Active Citizens (Amateurs)

*  Active Citizens (Subject Matter Experts)

Both amateurs and subject matter experts have a shared role in exploring action opportunities and making proposals.

However, subject matter experts have an additional role as a guide and a reviewer — they can share new action opportunities to the map, and they can evaluate proposals to add relevant details and determine feasibility.

## **Who else is working on similar solutions?  Why is Home unique or better?**

There are many apps and products focused on helping people make *individual* contributions towards conservation/environmental/sustainability efforts.

There are also a few early-stage social networks looking to do the same.

Finally, there are resources like Drawdown and the Energy Zones Mapping Tool, which can be impactful in the hands of organizations and high-up decisionmakers.

Home is unique, and potentially better, because of its map-based interface tied to high-impact actions — as well as it’s citizen-centric foundation.

For example …

1. The Home map can give citizens greater awareness of our global situation (imagine applying a Global Forest Watch filter, or an Ocean Plastic filter, to get a real sense of the state of our world) — and consequently, that awareness can generate greater urgency for taking action.
2. Map-based information can improve users' spatial/visual context, which can make the information presented inherently more actionable.
3. Home is oriented towards higher-impact collective efforts, which can be led by everyday citizens, as opposed to siloed individual efforts or actions customed for organizations and top-down decisionmakers.
4. Focused on collective efforts and providing visual context, Home has more potential for catalyzing social transmission, as compared to conventional social network feeds.

As a final note, [The Energy Zones Mapping Tool](https://ezmt.anl.gov/) is a strong example of visualizing environment-related opportunities (through the application of various filters as datasets.)

However, if you use the tool, you can see that it was clearly designed for high-level decisionmakers (specifically, [the Eastern Interconnected States Planning Council](https://ezmt.anl.gov/about_the_study)), and provides little information/context at the municipality or community level (where active citizens can take concrete efforts).

It also lacks the crowdsourcing and networking elements envisioned in Home (e.g. viewing public proposals, connecting with others involved), which limits the tool's potential for social transition.

## **Current Work**

-Laying the right groundwork from the project, in terms of design considerations and user experience 

-Exploring how knowledge from high-quality resources (e.g. Drawdown, Energy Zones Mapping Tool, Global Forest Watch) can be integrated/rendered into this project 

-Researching Pro-environmental Tipping Points and social transmission, and exploring how they can be incorporated in an impactful way 

-Experimenting and iterating on prototype designs 

-Determining software architecture (user roles, user actions, user flows) 

-Scoping the design and technical requirements for an alpha 

-Writing the codebase for the alpha (can build on some open-source projects)
